	<h1><a id="About_0"></a>About</h1>
	<p>The Avenger Movie Database is a collaborative project for the class Software Engineering at the University of Zurich Institute
		for Computer Science. The aim is to take a provided source file and Stakeholder text and develop an interactable movie
		database according to their specifications.</p>
	<h4><a id="Who_We_Are_3"></a>Who We Are</h4>
	<p>We are four students at the University of Zurich’s Institute for Computer Science studying Computer Science in various capacities.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Petra Wittwer</strong> has focused her attention on the backend database implementations, the parser and the export
			functionality but also helped us all in our own areas of work.</li>
		<li><strong>Selin Fabel</strong> has also concentrated on the backend implementations such as the parser, but has also worked
			on various other areas in the project including the table display.</li>
		<li><strong>Armando Müller</strong> has worked on the presentation and display side of the project such as the framework of
			the application and its styling, as well as tying the various components written by all of us together to a single whole.</li>
		<li><strong>Lukas Blumer</strong> has focused on the presentation and display side of the project as well, working on components
			such as the worldmap, pie chart, column chart and also the about page.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4><a id="Used_Tools_and_Resources_11"></a>Used Tools and Resources</h4>
	<p>In order to implement the designated features of the project we have used a number of tools and libraries.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html" target="_blank">Google Web Toolkit 2.7.0</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Charts API 0.9.9</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine" target="_blank">Google AppEngine 1.9.30</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://dillinger.io/" target="_blank">Dillinger</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2><a id="Notes_on_the_Use_of_the_Application_22"></a>Notes on the Use of the Application</h2>
	<p>In the following we would like to note some features of the application and inform about their limitations.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Display per Capita</strong> This button in the filter menu will display a worldmap using a selected dataset of
			a number of countries for comparison purposes. This dataset is not influenced by other filters as it is small due to data
			availability limitations. The formula is total movie releases divided by population times 100,000 (to achieve readable numbers).</li>
		<li><strong>Pie Chart</strong> The pie chart displays any information reduced by the chosen filters. Bear in mind though that
			when, for example, a filter for a certain country is set, it will still display other countries in the pie chart as many
			movies were produced in more than just one country.</li>
		<li><strong>Column Chart</strong> The Column Chart will not display the entire movie dataset as the visualization would simply
			become unreadable.</li>
		<li><strong>Table</strong> It is possible to sort the table alphabetically, according to release year or any other column by simply clicking on the column's header.</li>
		<li><strong>Worldmap</strong> There is a a limitation in the worldmap and per capita view on the side of the charts API, possibly related to certain browsers, in that it might take a while to draw all countries onto the map.</li>
		<li><strong>Timeline</strong> The timeline does not allow to increase the area the min and max year cover after it has been reduced. To increase the range, please use the Delete Chosen Filters button and set it anew.</li>
	</ul>
